## Inovice Processing
This project was developed in January of 2023. The idea for this program was to reduce time doing data entry tasks, fullfilling this requirements successfully, by reading PDF invoices from a specific bank and grouping
the records by description and summarising credits and debits.

# How does it work?
First you need to have access to PDF invoices from Banco Galicia for this code to work. Feel free to use this code and adapt it to your bank of preference.
With the PDF, you need to enter Tabula and select the tables you want to analyze from said document and download it as a script for the coordinates.
After this you can run the code, first it will create csvs and then merge them together. Make sure the final csv doesnÂ´t have wrong information!
When this is completed you can then analyze it to retrieve the information.

PS: the PDF format for the bank has changed since the development of this code, so it might need some adjustments for it to work properly.

Thanks for reading!
